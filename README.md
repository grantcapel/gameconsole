BRANCHES:
main: point of all last functional implementations in our project. Do not push onto this branch until working prototype is at a stage with a working feature. (We want to use our main for our actual project so if it gets broken due to someone coding and pushing to it we wont be in a good place)
prototyping: all features currently being developed will eventually be pushed/merged onto this branch. Once the features are in a working state and are fully built you can then merge this into main. This will update the main branch so that it will have all the new features.
prototyping - nameOfNewFeature: If you are working on development of a new feature, first create a new branch using the name "prototyping - nameOfNewFeature". Push all changes on to this. Once you have a working prototype of this you can then merge this branch into the "prototyping" branch and delete this branch all together (if you want).
